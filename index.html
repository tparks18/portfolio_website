        <p style="font-size: 35px" alignment: center>Before joining Coding Temple, I earned my Bachelor's in Psychology from Middlebury in 2018. After graduation, I entered
        the corporate wellness industry world as an Administrative Specialist at Vitality Group, Inc. I analyzed technical
        issues, diagnosed software bugs, and identified process improvements. As I learned how to service the users of our
        mobile and website health and wellness applications, I became interested in learning how to build an application.
        
        I started on Free Code Camp and joined meetups such as Chicago Python User Group and People of Color Code and Chill,
        where I met engineers who had broken into tech through a code boot camp by the self-taught route. I hope to become a
        comprehensive programmer through Coding Temple's unique hands-on, project-based learning approach.</p>
